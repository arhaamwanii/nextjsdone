NEXT.JS
    - front end is still controlled by react 
    -  routing in next.js
    - fetching and sending data 
    - a lot of shit

- eslint -- code quality and ruels to specify the around the project
- FOLDER
- APP FOLDER IS THE MAIN:
    - page.js
    - is reserverd, that it should render a page
    - it is a server component : this component
    - log state ment : will be outputted on the terminal
    - it is treated as a server the component
    - then this simple html is sent to be rendered

- ADDING THE PAGE (/nameofpage)
    - create a new folder and you have a new page
    - with "page.js" file inside of that
    - well going through -- using "anchor tag" will case our page to re render
    
    - client side code can also be used:
    - LINK COMPONENT 
    - we use LINK component insited of the ANCHOR Tag
    - link will cause client side rendering

PAGE.JS - defines the content of the shell(ACTUALL CONTENT)

LAYOUT.JS - defines the shell abound the Conten(WRAPPER)
    - at least one of the root layout files is needed
    - the folder it is created in it is applicable to those

    - in this we also create a react component
    <!-- THIS COMPONENT RENDERS THE HTML AND THE BODY TAG -->

    CONST = metadata

    - it is a resereved name 
    - all the comtent that goes into the TITLE will be put in this const/obj
    - we export a const which contains a OBJECT
    - inside of which we set the title descriotion of the project

    - children prop will contain the content of the pages that this layout is the wrapper around

    ICON.PNG

    - this is used as a favicon
    - can also categorize it as per folders
    
    REACT COMPONENT 

    - we can just create them just like in react
    - @ can be used to render reffer to the root direcltory while impoeting
    - inside of the jsconfig we have this seted up

ANOTHER WAY OF ROUTING 

    - dynamic Routing
    - when there are a lot of thing
